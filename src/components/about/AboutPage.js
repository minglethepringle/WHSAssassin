                    I (Mingle) do not control the release of safe items. Meredith Prince and Sam Goldstone do, and they run on their own schedule, not yours. Just remain patient.

                    Completely random times. It could be at 4AM, 11PM, or never.

                    <Card.Text>
                    I could, but it takes a lot of effort and I'm lazy. Targets are stored not as names (e.g. "Mingle Li") but as obscure IDs (e.g. "2lkdsx7jz98d"). This makes it more difficult to look up who is who, and plus, that's 100% unfair, so I don't do it.

                    On the home page, click the big red button on the bottom bar. It has an icon of a book with a skull on it. You <u>DO NOT</u> need to DM the Instagram account.

                    <Card.Text>
                    First off, all targets are randomly assigned. At the end of each round, all players who have not gotten their target out will be eliminated. The rest of the people will be reassigned to a new target â€“ your old target does not carry over.
